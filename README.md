# Labour_statistics_canada-2025_Rstudio
Analysis of 2025 Canadian labour statistics using R. 
Includes data manipulation and visualizations (time-series, bar charts etc.) with tidyverse, Dplyr and ggplot2. 
Demonstrates end-to-end workflow from raw StatsCan data to insights.

This project was created for my R programming course to help me get hands-on experience with dplyr and ggplot2 
using real data from Statistics Canada. I worked with several 2025 labour-market datasets and used them to 
explore trends across provinces, age groups, genders, and different employment types. It ended up being a great 
way to practice data wrangling, build visualizations, and develop some early exploratory insights.
